# Piggy Bank Application
  * This application contains support for the four basic REST commands: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE through the 
    vehicle of a basic PiggyBank Application on Java using Springboot for the Web Framework, Swagger for the UI, 
    and Gradle for building the application.
 * A pre-made Dockerfile is provided which allows you to download the source code onto your local machine, and 
    deploy it in the form of a container anywhere!
